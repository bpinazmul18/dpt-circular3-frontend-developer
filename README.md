This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/bpinazmul18/dpt-circular3-frontend-developer.git
#or
git@github.com:bpinazmul18/dpt-circular3-frontend-developer.git
#or
gh repo clone bpinazmul18/dpt-circular3-frontend-developer

```

Second, goto project directory:

```bash
cd dpt-circular3-frontend-developer

```

Third, create .env file from .env.example or use variable in .env file:

```bash
APP_BASE_API_URL=https://traveli-bd.vercel.app/api

```

Forth, install node packages and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
#or
yarn install
#or
pnpm i

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
